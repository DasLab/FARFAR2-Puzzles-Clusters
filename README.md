# FARFAR2-Puzzles-Clusters
The new Das lab RNA modeling method, FARFAR2, has been benchmarked against 21 RNA-Puzzles, as well as the FARFAR2-Motifs and FARFAR2-Classics benchmarks. The complete data set, comprising some 18,000,000 predicted structures, is available [here](https://purl.stanford.edu/fq893cm4516). 

Since that's a very large data set, here we have collected the top 10 cluster centers for each FARFAR2-Puzzles benchmark case, as well as the corresponding native structure and the best-scoring model from simulations that generated restrained natives.
